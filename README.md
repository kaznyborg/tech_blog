# Tech Blog
14 Model-View-Controller (MVC): 

## Description

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. Build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.

## Usage

A user will go to the given website. They will then be prompted to sign up. After entering a username and password, the user will be sent to their dashboard. Here all of the stored posts are shown. There will be a button to create a new post. This will load a new screen that will allow the user to create a new post. From the dashboard a user can also select an existing post. This will give the option to write and save a comment on the post.
